      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>Artists, &amp; Designers create custom pieces of art &mdash; anything from photos, to paitings, to prints, to sculptures.</p>

        <h3>Conceal</h3>
        <p>Artists hide their artwork around the city. After the artist hides their art, they post a photo clue to the FAF PHL Facebook page and tweet the same clue using #FAFPHL.</p>

        <h3>Consume</h3>
        <p>Anyone who finds a piece of art is free to take it! We only ask that you send a tweet or post to the FAF PHL Facebook page letting us know that the artwork has been found.</p>
